## Congratulations! You found me! Welcome to my GitHub, it's nice to have you here.

My name is Ben. I work as a chemistry teacher and academic intervention analyst in a high school. I love the challenge of explaining complex ideas and helping people gain new insights through good communication and clear data synthesis.
Much of the data I work with involves student grades, attendance, enrollment, and test scores, which I use to determine which subgroups of students are struggling and what supports are needed to get them back on track. At my school, 
I'm involved anywhere data can be used to answer questions, summarize information, and solve problems. I've created dashboards to keep an eye 
on key metrics and systems to pull necessary information together quickly to enable quick decision-making. Some of the tools I've used include Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau, and PowerBI. Please have a look around at some of the projects 
I've worked on and reach out to learn more.

# Some of My Data Projects
Click the link of each section to see more about that project.

## [Student Grade Map](https://github.com/byergs/Student-Grade-Map-Project)

### Excel | SQL | Python | Tableau

### Can student addresses be used to predict in advance which incoming freshmen are more likely to fail courses?

 - GPS coordinates were linked to student addresses and the number of failed courses for each student was calculated in SQL Server
     * Student address coordinates were adjusted to protect privacy but preserve approximate distribution

## [Resource Room Usage](https://github.com/byergs/Resource-Room-Usage.git)

### Excel (Pivot Tables)

### What Resource Rooms are used most often by students seeking help with classwork?

- Resource Rooms are a space in the building that students can utilize during their lunch period to get help with course work from content area teachers and peer tutors (Juniors and Seniors in Advanced Level Classes)
- Room attendance data was linked by student ID to school roster data to capture math courses of students checking in to get math support

## [Grade Distributions](https://github.com/byergs/Resource-Room-Usage.git)

### Excel: Pivot Tables & Power Query | Tableau

### How has the number of As, Bs, Cs, Ds, and Fs changed over time (pre- and post-COVID)?

- Final grades from 2016 to 2024 were exported to Excel and Power Query and Pivot Tables were used to clean and anonymize the data.
- Clean data was imported to Tableau and visualized in various ways to answer key questions.
