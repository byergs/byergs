## Congratulations! You found me! Welcome to my GitHub, it's nice to have you here.

My name is Ben. I work as a chemistry teacher and academic intervention analyst in a high school. I love the challenge of explaining complex ideas and helping people gain new insights through good communication and clear data synthesis.
Much of the data I work with involves student grades, attendance, enrollment, and test scores, which I use to determine which subgroups of students are struggling and what supports are needed to get them back on track. At my school, 
I'm involved anywhere data can be used to answer questions, summarize information, and solve problems. I've created dashboards to keep an eye 
on key metrics and systems to pull necessary information together quickly to enable quick decision-making. Some of the tools I've used include Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau, and PowerBI. Please have a look around at some of the projects 
I've worked on and reach out to learn more.

# Ben's Data Projects

## [Student Grade Map](https://github.com/byergs/Student-Grade-Map-Project)

### Excel | SQL | Python | Tableau

### Can student addresses be used to predict in advance which incoming freshmen are more likely to fail courses?

 - GPS coordinates were linked to student addresses and the number of failed courses for each student was calculated in SQL Server
     * Student address coordinates were adjusted to protect privacy but preserve approximate distribution

## [Resource Room Usage]

### Excel (Pivot Tables)

### What classes are represented most by students utilizing the Math Resource Room?

- Room attendance data was linked by student ID to school roster data to capture math courses of students checking in to get math support
